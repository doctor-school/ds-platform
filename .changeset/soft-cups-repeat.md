020 EARS-1 — one shared event-page core: `EventPageView` (the 004 public projection widened in place with `format` and `seatsLeft`) is now read by both storefronts, the doctor host through the new `GET /v1/storefront/doctor/events/:idOrSlug` that delegates to the same service. Participation is a single server-resolved policy — `ParticipationCta` (`register` · `registered` · `enter-room` · `switch-to-online` · `sold-out` · `unavailable`) — served as a per-viewer sibling read on each host, so neither storefront branches on lifecycle, registration, format or seats of its own.
