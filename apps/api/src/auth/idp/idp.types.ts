/**
 * The IdP rejected the supplied password as too weak for its configured policy

 * to `alreadyExisted` and treats every other failure as an opaque throw — but a
 * password-policy rejection is special: it is the residual race where the BFF
 * creation schema (which mirrors the deployed Zitadel default policy as a
 * baseline) passed, yet the *live* Zitadel is configured stricter than that
 * baseline and 400s inside `createUser`. The service catches THIS type and maps
 * it to a generic, non-enumerating "weak password" client error (422) — never a
 * 500, and identical regardless of whether the account exists. Zitadel v4.15
 * validates password complexity BEFORE the duplicate/uniqueness check (verified
 * live against the dev-stand: a second `createUser` on an existing email with a
 * policy-violating password returns 400 "Password must contain upper case", NOT
 * 409), so `existing+weak` and `new+weak` both 400 → this throw → the same 422,
 * and a *valid* duplicate is the 409 → `alreadyExisted` path that never reaches
 * here. No branch correlates with existence (no oracle). Any OTHER non-2xx from
 * `createUser` stays an opaque `Error` (a real server fault → 500), so this type
 * is the only password-correlated signal that crosses the port.
