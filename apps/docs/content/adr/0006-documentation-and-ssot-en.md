## Context

DS Platform is a greenfield TS/Postgres/Next.js platform being built by AI agents with a small team (1–2 devs + non-technical product owner Product Lead). Documentation is the primary mechanism for passing context between AI sessions and between team members. Without disciplined doc-as-SSOT, every AI session restart loses architectural intent.

ADR-0001..0005 locked in the technologies, but did not establish:

- Where documentation lives, who edits it, how it is rendered.
- Who is Master for each type of truth (Zod / Drizzle / glossary / prose).
- How drift between a document and the code is detected.
- Which format to use for feature specs (EARS + Event Modeling + Gherkin or free-form).
- Where Product Lead (non-technical, does not write markdown in an IDE) has a UI for PRD/Vision.

Hard requirements:

- Self-host (Federal Law 152-FZ; no Cloudflare/Vercel/Notion).
- AI-friendliness: AI reads docs at session start directly from the repo, without MCP-fetch proxies.
- Modern Notion-vibe UX for Product Lead (block-based, not classical wiki).
- Two-way markdown editing: Product Lead in UI ↔ Tech Lead/AI in IDE — single source.
- Mainstream stack, large LLM corpus (continuation of the [[feedback_tech_stack_criteria_no_team_skill]] principle).

Principle [[feedback_docs_as_ssot]] (STRICT): doc-first cycle, AI session starts by reading the relevant docs, every PR updates docs, docs do not contradict code by construction where possible (via codegen).

**Inheritance caveat (for transparency).** ADR-0006 architecturally inherits the unified TS stack from ADR-0002/0004 (TypeScript on backend and frontend → one language in Keystatic config, Fumadocs, generator scripts, ESLint custom rules, drift-detection tools). ADR-0002 §1 contains argumentation mentioning existing prototypes ("3 prototypes on Next.js") — this violates [[feedback_tech_stack_criteria_no_team_skill]], which was formulated later. ADR-0004 already noted this caveat. ADR-0006 does not invalidate ADR-0002/0004 in this sense (intrinsic criteria — LLM dataset, mainstream stack, RF self-host — are satisfied independently), but when revising ADR-0002 without the "3 prototypes" argument, Node.js must pass on clean criteria alone; otherwise the documentation stack requires revision.

## Decision

### 1. SSOT Topology — "SSOT-per-kind"

Principle 7 of the reference doc applied literally: each type of truth has exactly one home. Full table:

| Type of truth                                | Master                                                                                | Mechanism propagation                                                                                     |

| Business content (legal/team/marketing)      | Payload v3 collections                                                                | Build-time fetch / runtime API (ADR-0004 §7)                                                              |

| Tech specs (architectural brainstorm output) | `docs/content/specs/tech/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`                                             | DSO-25..29 pattern, Keystatic-editable                                                                    |
| Feature specs (SDD)                          | `docs/content/specs/features/NNN-name/` (req+design+scenarios — 3 files, no tasks.md) | EARS → unit tests; Gherkin → Playwright E2E; per-EARS GitHub Issues with label `feature:NNN-name`         |
| Implementation tasks (code-level)            | **GitHub Issues** in DS Platform repo (one Issue per EARS handler / bug / refactor)   | PR-linked, auto-close on merge; AI reads `gh issue view`; cross-link `tracker:` field in spec frontmatter |
| Strategic/PM tasks (non-code)                | **Plane** workspace `doctor-school` (DSP/DSC/DSM/DSO projects)                        | Strategic level, cross-team (product+legal+HR+marketing), Product Lead-native; cross-link via URL labels  |

| Operations (runbooks, monitoring)            | `apps/docs/content/operations/`                                                       | Fumadocs render                                                                                           |
| AI constitution                              | `AGENTS.md` (root) + `CLAUDE.md` (Claude-Code overrides)                              | Read by AI first at session start                                                                         |

"Copying a value between Masters is forbidden" — this is the best indicator of potential drift. If a value appears in two places, the second must be an auto-generated artifact, not a manual copy.

### 2. Doc Portal: **Fumadocs (Next.js + MDX)**

The rendering layer for technical documentation. Fumadocs satisfies the full set of requirements:

- Native Next.js 15 — lives as `apps/docs/` in the monorepo, shares the `pnpm` workspace, ESLint flat config, Tailwind tokens, Turborepo cache with all other apps.
- MDX + full freedom of React components inside (Scalar/Redoc embed, Mermaid, custom glossary tooltips).
- Tailwind + shadcn-style components — visual consistency with `apps/portal`/`apps/admin`.
- Doc-specific: auto-generated sidebar, search (Orama/Algolia integration), versioning, OpenAPI rendering plugin.
- MIT license.

**Alternatives and why not chosen:**

- **Starlight (Astro):** higher doc-specialization, Pagefind search built-in, but Astro is an additional toolchain on top of Next.js. Weighted score close (181 vs 157 at equal weights), user override in favor of stack consistency.
- **Docusaurus v3:** maximum maturity and plugin ecosystem, but React+webpack separate from the Next.js monorepo — disconnect from the rest of the infrastructure.
- **Nextra v3:** Next.js-native, but a general-purpose MDX framework with a doc theme; doc-specialization weaker than Fumadocs.
- ~~MkDocs Material~~: Python toolchain in a TS shop, dropped (explicit user override: "no dinosaurs from the 2000s").

**Risk acknowledged:** Fumadocs is young (~1.5 years, active release cycle, breaking changes possible). Mitigation: content = stock MDX, portable to Docusaurus/Starlight in a day without data loss.

**Diagrams in Fumadocs:** Mermaid via `remark-mdx-mermaid` remark plugin (external dependency, not a "built-in Fumadocs plugin"), wired in Fumadocs `source.config.ts`. Performance is acceptable (lazy-load client-side).

### 3. Markdown Editor (Notion-like UX for non-developers): **Keystatic**

A UI layer on top of the same `.md` / `.mdx` / `.yaml` files in Git. Two-way workflow:

- Product Lead edits prose pages (PRD, vision, business-rules, glossary) in the Keystatic UI. On save, Keystatic commits the file to Git via GitHub App.
- Tech Lead/AI edits the same files directly in the IDE — Keystatic picks up changes on the next open.

**Why Keystatic:**

- MIT, schema-as-code in TypeScript (collections, fields, blocks are typed).
- Block editor inspired by Notion 2024 — not a classical wiki, modern UX.
- Content = plain Markdown / MDX / YAML / JSON — AI reads directly without proprietary deserialization.
- Native Next.js App Router plugin (`makeRouteHandler` + `<KeystaticApp />`) — runs as `apps/docs-cms/` alongside `apps/docs/`.
- TypeScript schema enforces: typed fields, save-time validation in the UI, relationship references (cannot reference a non-existent glossary term).

**Self-host honest framing.** Keystatic `storage.kind: 'github'` uses the GitHub.com API for commits — meaning a dependency on GitHub.com (Microsoft US infrastructure) for the doc repo. The prose/specs/ADR/glossary docs **do not contain personal data (PD)** → Federal Law 152-FZ is not violated. Platform PD lives in RF-Postgres (ADR-0003) and Timeweb Object Storage (ADR-0002). Doc repo on GitHub.com is an acceptable trade-off, not "fully self-hosted." If full air-gap is required (e.g., upon loss of access to GitHub.com) — fallback to Keystatic `kind: 'local'` + self-hosted Gitea/GitLab. Trigger: GitHub.com blocked from the Russian Federation (RF), or a policy decision to move source code to RF.

**Content format (Markdoc vs MDX impedance).** Keystatic `fields.document` serializes to Markdoc-flavored markdown. Fumadocs expects MDX. For prose collections (PRD chapters, Vision, business-rules) `fields.document` is used — DSO-31 verifies on a pilot page that Markdoc output is readable by Fumadocs (via `fumadocs-mdx` or a separate markdoc→mdx transform). For glossary `definition` — short prose, format is not critical (rendered by a separate custom Fumadocs component).

**Alternatives and why not chosen:**

- **TinaCMS:** higher maturity (5+ years), live-preview of Next.js pages, but GraphQL layer adds complexity, Tina Cloud bias in out-of-box setup. Weighted score practically tied (147 vs 149). Trigger to revisit: Keystatic v1.0 release + first breaking change in Keystatic that breaks our CI.
- **Wiki.js:** classical wiki UX, not Notion-like blocks. AGPL. Bidirectional Git sync — powerful, but interval-based (not instant). Score 122.
- ~~Outline/AFFiNE/AppFlowy/HedgeDoc~~: store data in their own DB, not in Git. AI-friendliness drops (requires MCP-fetch + cron snapshot for AI), drift risk is high. Rejected.

**Risk acknowledged:** Keystatic v0.x, breaking changes possible. Mitigation: content = plain `.md` files in Git, editor swappable to TinaCMS/Pages-CMS without data loss.

### 4. Spec Format: **Hybrid B (tech-spec brainstorm + feature-spec SDD)**

Two adjacent templates, each with its own discipline:

**Tech specs** — `docs/content/specs/tech/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.

- Continues the DSO-25..29 pattern: brainstorming skill → design spec → ADR.
- Use cases: tech-stack selection, infra decisions, integration patterns, migration plans.
- Free-form structure, but with mandatory sections: Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives, Open Questions.

**Feature specs** — `docs/content/specs/features/NNN-<feature-name>/`.

- SDD structure (3 files, no `tasks.md` — tasks live in GitHub Issues, not in Git, see §9 below):
- `requirements.md` — frontmatter with `tracker:` (GitHub milestone URL) + Outcomes / Scope / Constraints / Prior decisions / **Event Model (Commands/Events/Read models/Policies)** / **EARS requirements** (one per handler) / Invariants / Verification.
- `design.md` — Mermaid sequence diagrams of cascades, state diagrams of lifecycles, ER fragments.
- `scenarios.feature` — Gherkin, happy path + 2–3 failure branches.
- If a feature has a long transaction with compensations — a "Saga" section is added to `requirements.md` (reference doc §5.6) with an explicit compensate-mapping per step and failure policy.
- Decomposition into atomic tasks (one EARS-handler ≈ one Issue) is done **in GitHub Issues** (see §9), not in a Git file. Git holds intent (EARS-N), GitHub Issues hold execution state (assignee, status, PR-link, comments).

**EARS numbering — flat by default.** EARS requirements in `requirements.md` are numbered `EARS-1`, `EARS-2`, `EARS-3`, … without a `.M` sub-component, regardless of total count. The Vitest test naming follows: `it('EARS-N: when <trigger>, system shall <behavior>', () => { … })`. Nested `EARS-N.M` is allowed **only** when a single handler genuinely carries multiple shall-clauses (e.g., an OIDC-callback handler that both upserts a doctor profile and emits a `DoctorRegistered` event — `EARS-3.1` create/upsert + `EARS-3.2` emit). The trigger for nesting is "one EARS sentence becomes hard to write without 'and' or 'while'"; if a flat number suffices, use a flat number. The `ears-tests` lint guard (ADR-0007 §2.6) reads both forms.

Outputs of Spec-Driven Development:

- EARS-handlers → unit tests (Vitest), one EARS ≈ one test.
- Gherkin scenarios → Playwright E2E (via `playwright-bdd` transpilation).
- Event Model → NestJS modules (Commands = controllers, Events = outbox emits, Policies = handlers).
- Invariants → property-based tests (deferred to v2+).

### 5. AI Constitution: AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md split

`AGENTS.md` at the root of the DS-Platform repo — **universal constitution** for all AI agents (Claude/Cursor/Cody/GPT-Codex). Contains: stack list, repo doc structure, mandatory "Before any task" / "During implementation" / "After implementation" checklists, PR requirements, forbidden actions (silent arch changes, hardcoded glossary IDs, etc.). Immutable in substance — updated only when a new architecture layer is added. Structure follows reference doc §4.1.

`CLAUDE.md` — Claude-Code-specific overlay. Contains: a link to AGENTS.md as baseline, MCP server config, Claude-Code skill preferences (pp-plane CLI first), tool-allowlist, hook patterns, slash-command shortcuts. May change frequently.

`.cursor/rules/` — added when/if Cursor joins the team.

### 6. Glossary Mechanism: glossary.yaml + 4-layer validation + roundtrip check

Described in detail in design spec §6 with code sketches. Summary:

- Master = `apps/docs/content/product/glossary/*.md` (Keystatic file-per-term collection, frontmatter YAML + markdown body for definition).
- Generated artifact = `packages/glossary/ids.ts` (TS const enum) + sync to Payload Glossary Collection.
- 4 client-facing validation layers + 1 CI roundtrip check:

1.  **Keystatic UI** — typed fields, relationship references, save-blocking validators.
2.  **MDX glossary-lint** — custom AST parser scans `[[term-id]]` directives and bold tokens in `apps/docs/content/**/*.{md,mdx}`; unknown term without a `<!-- new-term -->` marker → fail.
3.  **ESLint `@ds/glossary-canonical-ids`** — TS literals matching a GlossaryId must be imported from `@ds/glossary/ids`, not be an inline string.
4.  **Payload Lexical glossary-ref check** — every `<GlossaryRef id="...">` in a Payload Lexical AST export exists in the glossary.

- **Roundtrip CI check** — glossary.yaml ↔ generated TS ids ↔ Payload Glossary table consistent (runs post-sync).

**Not v1 (deferred):**

- AsyncAPI — no external event bus (outbox/Centrifugo internal do not require AsyncAPI v1).
- Pact contract testing — after first external integration (ADR-0002 OQ8).
- Property-based invariant tests — after the first product-complex feature.
- Coverage thresholds — after 3 months in production.

### 8. Diagrams: Mermaid only in v1

Sequence / state / ER / C4Context — all Mermaid in MDX. Rendering — Fumadocs built-in Mermaid plugin. C4 modeling via Mermaid v10+ `C4Context` shape.

**Trigger to revisit:** 10+ components in an architecture diagram, or 3+ stakeholders regularly reading arch docs — switch to Structurizr DSL (text-based C4, multiple views) or d2.

### 9. Task-tracker split: Plane (strategic) + GitHub Issues (code-level)

To avoid false-SSOT in Git (`tasks.md`), task execution state lives in task trackers. **Two trackers — two distinct zones of responsibility**, cross-linked via URL.

| What we track                                                                          | Where                                             | Why                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stack ADRs, infra milestones, product/PM decisions, hiring, fundraising                | Plane workspace `doctor-school` (DSP/DSC/DSM/DSO) | Strategic level, cross-team, Product Lead works in Plane natively, CLAUDE.md pp-plane-first rule                                             |
| Implementation tasks for DS Platform code (EARS handlers, bugs, refactors, deps, perf) | **GitHub Issues** in DS Platform repo             | PR-native (auto-close, mention, sub-issues, GitHub Projects v2), AI works with `gh` CLI in the repo, milestones cleanly map to feature specs |
| Cross-cutting initiatives (release planning, infrastructure milestone)                 | Plane parent + GitHub Milestone children          | Strategic owner = Plane, implementation details = GitHub                                                                                     |

**GitHub Issues convention for feature implementation:**

- **One Milestone per feature** (e.g., `001-doctor-onboarding`), description contains a link to `apps/docs/content/specs/features/001-doctor-onboarding/requirements.md`.
- **One Issue per EARS-handler** — title `[001] EARS-3: When OIDC callback received, the system shall ...`, body contains a link to the specific EARS-ID in requirements.md.
- **Labels** — `feature:NNN-name`, `kind:ears-handler` / `kind:bug` / `kind:refactor` / `kind:dep-upgrade`.
- **GitHub Project v2** — "DS Platform Implementation" board with swimlanes by feature.

**Cross-linking:**

- Plane Issue → GitHub: URL in description or comment.
- GitHub Issue → Plane: URL in body, optional label `plane:DSO-N`.
- Feature spec → GitHub Milestone: frontmatter field `tracker: <github-milestone-url>` in `requirements.md`.

**AI agent workflow:**

- Start of session in DS Platform repo: `gh issue view N` → read linked feature spec → implement → PR auto-close on merge.
- AI agent does NOT open Plane for code-level work — that would create friction. Plane is opened only for strategic context (e.g., reading a DSO-ADR when referenced).

**Plane CLI rule:** `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` fix the rule: "`gh` CLI first for code-level Issues; pp-plane — for cross-tracker references only (Plane DSO-XXX from an ADR/spec)."

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Single Git Master for all prose+tech** — no drift between Notion/Outline and the code; AI reads directly.
- **Keystatic over Git** gives Product Lead a Notion-like UX without a separate prose store: edit in UI = commit to Git = visible to AI in the next session.
- **Fumadocs as a Next.js app** — unified toolchain (Turborepo cache, shared ESLint/Tailwind/TS config) for docs+portal+admin+promo+cms.
- **SSOT-per-kind table** — a formal map of who is Master for what, codegen where possible, automatically catches drift.
- **EARS+Event Model in feature specs** gives AI a structured prompt for generating NestJS handlers + Vitest tests + Playwright E2E — one source, three artifacts.
- **AGENTS.md split** allows adding Cursor/Codex without rewriting CLAUDE.md.
- **Drift detection across 12 checks** catches divergences at PR time; development does not drift from the specification.
- **Self-hosted runtime stack** (Keystatic admin, Fumadocs portal, lint tools) — all compute within the RF zone. Documentation in Git on GitHub.com is an acceptable trade-off (no PD in doc repo), Federal Law 152-FZ is not violated. Trigger to revisit: GitHub.com blocked or a policy decision to move source code to RF (Gitea/GitLab self-host).
- **Content portability**: content = stock `.md`/`.mdx`/`.yaml` — editor and portal are swappable without data loss.

### Negative

- **Keystatic v0.x maturity risk** — breaking changes possible every 3–6 months. Mitigation: content-portable; pin minor version; CI smoke-test after Keystatic upgrade.
- **Fumadocs young (~1.5 years)** — smaller plugin ecosystem than Docusaurus, OpenAPI integration requires manually embedding a Scalar/Redoc React component. Mitigation: content-portable.
- **Product Lead learning Keystatic** — block editor is simpler than an IDE, but still a new environment; first month + tutorial.
- **Glossary 4-layer validation** requires writing ~3 custom lint scripts in `tools/lint/` (~300 lines of TS). Not trivial, but a straightforward pattern.
- **Custom ESLint rule `glossary-canonical-ids`** — one more thing to maintain. Mitigation: standalone package, tested separately.
- **EARS + Event Modeling + Gherkin discipline** requires training; the first feature spec is written more slowly. Mitigation: payoff on codegen tests from the second feature onward.
- **Sync glossary.yaml → Payload Glossary Collection** — one more CI script, idempotency required.
- **Mermaid-only — render is limited** for complex C4. Trigger to revisit is recorded.

### Risks

- **Keystatic + Fumadocs combined youth** — both are young; theoretically possible for both to break simultaneously on a major Next.js upgrade. Mitigation: pin major Next.js, run upgrades through a canary branch.
- **Product Lead continues writing in Notion despite Keystatic** — a social risk. Mitigation: explicitly state that Notion is no longer Master for DS Platform docs"; deactivate the corresponding Notion pages (or make them a read-only mirror via CI).
- **AI agent writes to `apps/docs/content/` directly, breaking Keystatic schema** — e.g., adds a `.md` file without required frontmatter. Mitigation: CI schema-validation for Keystatic collections — fail if a file does not conform to the schema.

## Related ADRs / Delegated

**Inherited from:**

- ADR-0001 — single OIDC tenant (Authentik **or Zitadel** — final choice pending ADR-0001 §8 spike) for Keystatic admin login, same tenant as Refine admin (`apps/admin`)
- ADR-0002 — Zod schemas + nestjs-zod + openapi-typescript → SDK
- ADR-0003 — Drizzle schemas + drizzle-kit
- ADR-0004 — Payload v3 Glossary Collection, Next.js 15 + Tailwind + shadcn for all apps
- ADR-0005 — Module README pattern reused in `apps/mobile/src/modules/`

**Delegated to other tasks:**

- **DSO-31 (Repo strategy / Engineering readiness):** monorepo tooling finalization (Turborepo); CI workflow.yml; Fumadocs setup; Keystatic setup; AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md draft; first glossary YAML scaffold; lint-tools package; sync-glossary-to-payload script; deployment domain `docs.doctor.school` + `docs-cms.doctor.school`.
- **Phase 0.5 after DSO-31:** first feature spec in SDD format as acceptance proof.
- **DSO-32 (Legal):** status of DS Platform Notion pages after migration — read-only mirror or deprecation.

**Impacts (downstream blockers):**

- **DSO-31** — structure of `apps/docs/`, `apps/docs-cms/`, `packages/glossary/`, `tools/lint/`.
- **Payload Phase 0 implementation** — Payload Glossary Collection requires canonical glossary as SSOT.
- **Feature specs DS Platform code** — spec format is locked, work can begin on `docs/content/specs/features/001-*/` for the first product feature.
