### Minor Changes

- [#1058](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/1058) [`036ad36`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/036ad361041800f28509077c53c5f2abc4fb0651) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(portal): 004 EARS-19 — month-calendar view at `/webinars?view=month` (desktop 7-column grid, mobile dot-grid + selected-day agenda). Adds the display-only `MonthCalendarGrid`, `MonthDotGrid`, and `DayAgenda` presentation blocks to `@ds/design-system` (token-only, catalogued in the showcase), and wires the portal pane: current-МСК-month projection read, live pill/dot from `EventLifecycleState`, muted past-day notes, today outline, state legend, and the «Неделя / Месяц» switcher ([#1050](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/1050)).

- [#1060](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/1060) [`952645b`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/952645b4ea780989996d4a1e00a18ec8e0718fde) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(portal): 004 EARS-17/18 — month navigation (‹ › paging + 12-month picker) and the «Неделя / Месяц» view switcher on `/webinars?view=month`. Adds the display-only `MonthPicker` presentation block to `@ds/design-system` (native `<details>` disclosure, year ‹ › stepper, per-month event counts, past months muted «прошёл»; token-only, catalogued in the showcase) and wires the portal month toolbar: server-component query-param paging (validated `month`, absent/malformed → current МСК month), the `MonthlyEventCount` picker feed, a «Сегодня» reset, and the shared `ViewSwitcher` that carries the displayed month so the week↔month round-trip is loss-free ([#1051](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/1051)).

### Patch Changes

- [#1062](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/1062) [`a6a5f9b`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/a6a5f9bd00d79da0433d50ee5e6dba721154ed33) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - fix(portal): /account «Сменить пароль» helper now says «Отправим код для сброса пароля на email» — the old «ссылку» wording contradicted the code-only reset contract (003-design §13.4).

- [#1007](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/1007) [`1981366`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/198136699afedd5f1718d5e38efcf0e441cf9483) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - Portal header: immediate post-login auth affordance (no hard reload) + silhouette avatar fallback for no-display-name doctors

- [#1034](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/1034) [`acd1f38`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/acd1f388bae4b39e02f46d6409ef07bd27b404b8) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - The /login, /register and /reset page titles now render as a real `h1` heading (exactly one per page) instead of a plain `div`, so screen readers and assistive tech see the page structure. Purely semantic — the visual rendering is unchanged.

- [#1072](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/1072) [`3f9cca7`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/3f9cca7cead1783cf956f9d6fa6249e9246d52e4) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - Month view canvas-parity rework ([#1065](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/1065), Stage-B verdict at [#1052](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/1052)): 1240px calendar column, toolbar overlapping the hero band, kicker-free hero on the `hero` token with the canvas tagline (shared with the week listing), 3-pill day cap with the «+N ещё» link into the week listing's new per-day anchors, next-month legend link, and the canvas mobile toolbar arrangement.

- [#1037](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/1037) [`ce1efe0`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/ce1efe039ac0443c926e6a5263c34e8141c375ff) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - The /verify page title now renders as a real `h1` heading (exactly one on the page) instead of a plain `div`, matching the /login, /register and /reset fix — screen readers and assistive tech now see the page structure. Purely semantic — the visual rendering is unchanged.

The portal `/verify` screen now seeds the email from the fragment (query `?email=` kept as a same-tab/backward-compat fallback) and a validation-blocked submit (e.g. no identifier) surfaces a visible localized error instead of a silent no-op.

  upcoming-broadcasts listing (`/webinars`) instead of the 003-era «Каркас приложения»
  scaffold card, and the default post-login landing (no `returnTo`) is «Мои события»
  (`/account/events`) instead of the `/account` session dump. The guard-validated
  `?returnTo=/webinars/:slug` registration-resume path is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

The AA fix is delivered by deepening the shared `header` band to blue.700 (white = 8.14:1, genuine WCAG-AA in both themes) — the earlier `primary-surface` plate treatment is reverted. The room-route axe e2e scan now includes the `.bg-header` band (no longer excluded).

### Minor Changes

- [#703](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/703) [`29ae731`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/29ae731096a929745d64800e97d059bded702605) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(room): 006 [#690](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/690) — realize deferred webinar-room header canvas elements (live presence count + live-duration)

  Realizes two of the four canvas header elements [#584](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/584) deferred as tracked
  decision-debt, each now backed by real data (no faked/hardcoded values):

  - **Live presence count** («N врачей в комнате») — a server-side aggregate over
    the existing append-only `presence_beats`: the count of distinct doctors with a
    beat inside the freshness window (2 × the heartbeat cadence N). It rides the
    EARS-1 `RoomConfig` grant (initial value) and every heartbeat ack (live
    refresh), and the portal header renders it desktop-only per the canvas. An
    integer aggregate only — never per-doctor identity or the roster (EARS-8).
  - **Live-duration «· N мин»** on the live pill — counted from the event's actual
    go-live instant. Adds a nullable `events.live_at` column stamped once by 007
    `OpenRoom` (the `published → live` transition); the grant exposes it and the
    room counts elapsed minutes from it, never the scheduled `startsAt`. A legacy
    `live` row with no `live_at` renders the pill with no suffix (truthful).

  Additive schema growth (`RoomConfig.liveAt` + `RoomConfig.presenceCount`,
  `PresenceHeartbeatAck.presenceCount`) and one additive migration
  (`events.live_at`). The theme toggle (re-deferred to [#702](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/702), dark theme with it)
  and the doctor avatar (no server-side display name exists — re-deferred) remain
  canvas omissions, never dead affordances.

- [#704](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/704) [`54e425d`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/54e425dda80c41de342e87c3b405bc7c1606197f) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(webinars): 006 EARS-6 — «мои события» room-entry CTA + WebinarCard nested-anchor resolution ([#689](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/689))

  A registered doctor could enter a live webinar room from the event page ([#584](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/584)) but
  not from «мои события», where each event renders as a `WebinarCard`. The card was a
  whole-card `<a>`, so a room-entry CTA could not be added without nesting interactive
  content inside an anchor.

  - `@ds/design-system`: `WebinarCard` now matches its canvas — the root is a
    container and the title is a stretched link (`::after` overlay), so the whole card
    still opens its event page while an optional secondary action fits alongside with
    no nested anchor. Two additive props (`ctaHref`, `ctaLabel`) render a room-entry
    button (`Button`, filled primary) as a sibling with its own stacking context;
    omitting them keeps the listing card rendering as a single link. **BREAKING:**
    `WebinarCard`'s root element changes `<a>` → `<div>`, its forwarded ref type
    changes `HTMLAnchorElement` → `HTMLDivElement`, and its props base changes
    `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"a">` → `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">` (anchor-only
    props such as `target`/`rel` are no longer accepted on the card root).
  - `@ds/portal`: `/account/events` renders the «Войти в эфир» room-entry CTA on a
    registered + `live` event, routing to `/webinars/:slug/room` via the hardened
    `resolveRoomEntryHref`; copy reuses the `webinar.registered.live.cta` catalog key.

  An already-authenticated visitor could still open the portal auth surfaces
  (`/login`, `/register`, `/reset`, `/verify`) and the admin `/login`, and re-walk
  the whole register→verify→login flow. Now an authenticated visitor hitting any of
  those surfaces is redirected to their destination (portal → `/account`, admin →
  the `events` root) with no auth form rendered: the portal wires a single session
  guard into the shared `<AuthShell>`, and the admin wraps its login form in Refine's
  `<Authenticated>`.

### Minor Changes

- [#629](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/629) [`f27ecbf`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/f27ecbf5cf35ab6b4d8bc853086886c5ee8b8642) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(events): 004 EARS-3 — single «Участвовать» CTA + event-context handoff to 005/003

  The public event page (`/webinars/:slug`) now carries exactly **one** primary
  «Участвовать» CTA that routes the visitor into the registration flow (feature 005) through auth (feature 003), carrying the event context so it survives the
  round-trip (feature 004, EARS-3; realizes US-3).

  - `@ds/portal` — the CTA is the adopted `@ds/design-system` `Button` (filled
    blue.700 primary action, [#270](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/270)) linking to a same-origin registration href
    (`lib/registration-handoff`): `/register?returnTo=/webinars/:slug`. The event
    context rides as a **safe, same-origin** `returnTo` (no PII, no credential, no
    open-redirect — the slug is escaped and always anchored under `/webinars/`),
    matching the intent contract 005's design pins (§3.2). The CTA is present for a
    participable event (`published` / `live`) and **absent** for `ended` (never a
    dead link, EARS-3 invariant). Copy resolves through the 003 message catalog
    (EARS-13); DS tokens only (EARS-14).

  004 owns the CTA and the context handoff only — the registration mechanics and
  the guest→auth→registered round-trip are owned by 005/003 (a tracked seam, parent
  [#549](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/549); the handoff target is stubbed in 004's E2E). The full per-state affordance
  swap (badge / time plate / room-routing / footer band) is EARS-4; the archived
  notice EARS-5.

- [#635](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/635) [`774f018`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/774f01864032e0f95d5f11d56ec7e784ebc8d70a) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(events): 004 EARS-4 — event-page lifecycle render swap (upcoming/live/ended)

  The public event page (`/webinars/:slug`) now reflects the event's current
  lifecycle from the single `EventLifecycleState`, swapping the hero badge, the
  status-card time plate, the CTA affordance, and the footer band per the canvas
  `status` enum — never a signal that contradicts the machine (feature 004,
  EARS-4; realizes US-6).

  - `@ds/design-system` — new `WebinarStatusCard` primitive: the pulled-up
    «статус-карточка» from `webinar-page.dc.html`, reusing the webinar-card
    time-plate geometry (desktop `196px 1fr` grid, 2px border, `6px 6px 0` cast,
    56px time) with a head/sub signal and a single primary-CTA **slot**. Off-scale
    geometry lives in the DS SoT; tokens only, both themes; the `ended` render
    passes no CTA (no dead link). Registered in the showcase `/primitives` route
    (unit-as-subject) so the `playwright-axe` gate scans it — WCAG AA in both themes.
  - `@ds/portal` — `/webinars/:slug` composes the status card + footer band and
    drives the per-state swap via the pure `lib/event-lifecycle` mapping:
    **upcoming** (`published`) → «Участвовать» into the registration handoff
    (EARS-3); **live** → a «В эфире» signal + «Участвовать» routing TOWARD the
    room (feature 006, `buildRoomHref` → `/webinars/:slug/room`; 004 asserts the
    route, not the room); **ended** → the ended affordance with NO participation
    CTA and no footer band. The single primary «Участвовать» CTA is preserved
    (EARS-3 invariant); the footer band carries a distinct verb («Записаться» /
    «Смотреть эфир»). МСК time (EARS-12), catalog copy (EARS-13), DS tokens
    (EARS-14). Archived is the sibling EARS-5 notice — not built here.

  004 asserts the live-state routing target only — the webinar room and its
  server-side join gating are feature 006 (a tracked seam, parent [#549](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/549), design §8).

- [#638](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/638) [`51d7e66`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/51d7e6673d52c765f6c2886a7aeea3c30faafce5) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(events): 004 EARS-5 — archived direct-link public «в архиве» notice (no CTA)

  A previously-distributed direct link to an event that has since been `archived`
  now degrades gracefully in place instead of dead-ending (feature 004, EARS-5;
  realizes US-6, US-5; owner decision, variant «а»).

  - `@ds/portal` — the public event page (`/webinars/:slug`) renders the archived
    «мероприятие в архиве» notice as the **fourth** render mode on the same
    `WebinarStatusCard` shell (beyond the canvas's `upcoming | live | ended`): a
    plain text notice replaces the status card's CTA column — **no** participation
    CTA, **no** dead link, **no** new geometry (design §5.1). The hero badge reads
    «В архиве» and the footer conversion band is absent. All copy resolves through
    the 003 message catalog (`statusCard.archived.*`, EARS-13); DS tokens only, the
    notice using the card-safe `text-primary-action` (blue.700) on `bg-card`
    (the [#270](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/270) precedent), never `text-primary` (EARS-14).

  The API side is unchanged: `GET /v1/public/events/:idOrSlug` already resolves an
  `archived` event to a `200 PublicEventPage {state: archived}` (never a 404, never
  a redirect) — the archived-link contract is now pinned by a dedicated Vitest e2e
  (`archived.e2e-spec.ts`) and driven end-to-end on the live stand by the portal
  Playwright coverage. Event authoring / lifecycle transitions remain feature 007
  (a tracked seam, parent [#549](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/549); archived events are seeded until 007 lands).

- [#619](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/619) [`67b3da5`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/67b3da505dcfc35fac2b7ba7dd13e6d8d0bcec1e) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(events): 004 EARS-8 — full webinar-card listing unit + event-page link

  Replaces the wave-1 minimal listing card with the full `webinar-card.dc.html`
  unit and links each card to its event page (feature 004, EARS-8; carries
  EARS-12/13/14 on the card).

  - `@ds/design-system` — new `WebinarCard` listing primitive
    (`@ds/design-system/webinar-card`): the tinted 196px time plate (56px display
    time, explicit МСК label, day·weekday sub-label), school kicker, title,
    specialty chips, and speakers, rendered as a single block-level link. Off-scale
    canvas geometry lives in the design-system SoT (the app-scoped arbitrary-value +
    rhythm gates forbid it in `apps/*`); colour + type flow through tokens, both
    themes, desktop grid / mobile flat full-bleed per the canvas.
  - `@ds/portal` — the `/webinars` listing now renders each card as the `WebinarCard`
    unit (МСК times, no local drift; RU copy via the message catalog), each linking
    to `/webinars/:slug`.

- [#646](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/646) [`1547fa4`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/1547fa4afa1ffcf84290e28a9b2eef368743763c) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(events): 005 EARS-2 — guest-through-auth completion carrying event context (003 round-trip)

  A guest activating «Участвовать» is now carried through the shipped 003
  login/signup flow with the **event context** and comes out **registered for that
  same event**, landing back on that event page — no re-search, no second
  «Участвовать» tap (feature 005, EARS-2; realizes US-2). This retires the legacy
  "postponed registration" parking mechanism: there is **no** server-side pending
  record — the intent lives only in the round-trip and the real `RegisterForEvent`
  (EARS-1) fires once, after the session exists.

  - `@ds/schemas` (additive) — `RegistrationIntent` / `RegistrationIntentSchema`
    (strict: the intent carries the event slug + a same-origin
    `returnTo=/webinars/:slug` only — **never** PII or a credential; any extra
    field is rejected) and the `parseReturnTarget` / `isSafeReturnTarget`
    open-redirect guard: a cross-origin, protocol-relative, backslash,
    multi-segment, traversal, or percent-encoded-separator return target resolves
    to `null`, and a safe one reconstructs the canonical `/webinars/<slug>` from
    the validated slug.
  - `@ds/portal` — the returnTo survives every hop of the auth round-trip
    (`/register → /verify`, the `/verify → /login` fallback, and the cross links
    between the auth pages) via the guard-cleaning `withReturnTarget`; on auth
    success — password login, OTP login, or the post-verify auto-login replay —
    `completeReturnTarget` fires the same `RegisterForEvent` through the
    same-origin BFF path (`lib/registration-client`) and lands the doctor on the
    event page registered (best-effort: a transient register failure still lands
    on the event page, where the per-user state read / idempotent retry recovers).
    Without a carried context the shipped `/account` landing is unchanged; a
    hostile returnTo is dropped at every hop and never navigated to.

  The live browser E2E for the full guest journey is batched at the 005
  portal-integration slice ([#574](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/574)).

  The webinar event page now reflects the **authenticated** doctor's true
  registration state (feature 005, EARS-4; realizes US-3). A registered doctor sees
  a «вы записаны» confirmation + a join-signpost placeholder **replacing** the
  register CTA — never the «Участвовать» CTA as if unregistered; an unregistered
  doctor (and a guest) sees the shipped 004 register CTA unchanged.

  - `@ds/portal` — the SSR `/webinars/:slug` route composes the per-user state onto
    the 004 page via a **separate authenticated read** (`lib/registration-state` →
    `GET /v1/events/:idOrSlug/registration`), forwarding the request's session
    cookie **and** its fingerprint surface (`user-agent` + `accept-language`, the
    ADR-0001 §6 session binding) so the api resolves the `__Host-` session
    server-side. It is `cache: "no-store"` and never folded into the public
    `GetPublicEventPage` projection or its shared data cache — 004's public page
    stays byte-for-byte content-identical for guest and principal (a guest never
    issues the read). The registered swap replaces only the `register` CTA
    (upcoming), suppressing the footer «Записаться» band too; the `live` room route
    and `ended`/`archived` renders are untouched (the registered `live` onward path
    is EARS-5, [#569](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/569)).

  The full join-signposting content is EARS-5 ([#569](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/569)); the live browser E2E for the
  end-to-end registered journey is batched at the 005 portal-integration slice
  ([#574](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/574)). Verified live on the dev stand (registered doctor: confirmation + no
  register CTA; guest: 004 register CTA + public page uncontaminated).

  Where the room is open, a gated doctor reads the live chat and posts messages that
  fan out to every participant in real time without a reload, over the room channel
  keyed by event id (feature 006, EARS-3; realizes US-2). Chat rides Centrifugo,
  already in the stack — 006 adds a `room:event:<id>` channel + a gate-scoped,
  subscribe-only connection token, not a new transport.

  - `@ds/schemas` — the room DTOs grow additively: `RoomConfig.chat`
    (`{ url, token, channel, selfTag } | null`, the subscribe-only Centrifugo
    credential), `PostChatMessageRequest` (`{ text }`, validated by the
    `ChatMessageTextSchema` SSOT — trimmed, non-empty, ≤2000), the published
    `RoomChatMessage` (`{ id, authorTag, text, at }` — PII-free), and
    `PostChatMessageAck`.
  - `@ds/api` — `POST /v1/events/:idOrSlug/chat` (`PostChatMessage`), behind the
    **same** admission gate as EARS-1 (`authenticated ∧ registered ∧ live`): the
    backend authorizes, then publishes to Centrifugo over the HTTP API — the **only**
    publish path. The `RoomConfig` grant carries a connection JWT whose `channels`
    claim is gate-scoped to exactly the caller's room channel and grants **no**
    publish capability, so a client can never publish directly. A guest (401),
    unregistered (403), or non-`live` (409) caller publishes nothing (EARS-8); a
    Centrifugo outage is a 503. Author identity is a non-reversible, non-PII tag
    (`authorTag`), never the roster identity. Classified `authenticated` /
    `doctor_guest` / `policy` in the endpoint-authz matrix. Config (`CENTRIFUGO_*`)
    is read from env; unconfigured ⇒ `chat: null` (fail-closed).
  - `@ds/portal` — the room's chat aside is now live: it subscribes over Centrifugo
    (`centrifuge`, MIT) and renders others' messages in real time without a reload,
    and the composer posts through the gated command. The composer enforces the same
    `ChatMessageTextSchema` reject rule as the server (empty / whitespace-only stays
    unsendable). All copy resolves through the typed message catalog (EARS-10); built
    from `@ds/design-system` tokens (EARS-11).

  Room-close refusal of posts (EARS-7, [#583](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/583)) and the full both-breakpoints × both-
  themes fidelity + Stage-B live confirmation ([#584](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/584)) are tracked separately.

- [#683](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/683) [`f20f1da`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/f20f1da596fce75b03c6696b968e52f95566934c) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(room): 006 EARS-4 — server-authoritative heartbeat presence capture (append-only)

  While a gated doctor is in a live room with the tab visible, the client posts an
  authenticated heartbeat every N seconds and the backend appends each accepted
  beat to a durable append-only Postgres table — the durable basis for the
  per-doctor sponsor minutes (feature 006, EARS-4; realizes US-3).

  - `@ds/schemas` — new `PresenceHeartbeatAckSchema` (`{ eventId, beatAt }`): the
    server-authoritative ack of one accepted beat. `beatAt` is the server-stamped
    instant the row was appended, never a client-supplied count/timestamp — a
    client cannot inflate its own presence (requirements Constraints).
  - `@ds/db` — new append-only `presence_beats` table `(id, user_id, event_id,
beat_at)` (ADR-0003 §3). Immutable rows (no mutable column → nothing to update
    in place); `beat_at` defaults to the server clock; a composite
    `(event_id, user_id, beat_at)` index serves the EARS-5 derivation read.
  - `@ds/api` — `POST /v1/events/:idOrSlug/heartbeat` → `RecordPresenceHeartbeat`,
    behind the **same** server-side gate as the EARS-1 `RoomConfig` read (one gate,
    reused): a guest (401), an unregistered doctor (403), and a non-`live` / `ended`
    event (409) are each refused server-side and append **nothing** (EARS-8). On
    admission it appends exactly one row and returns the ack. Classified
    `authenticated` / `doctor_guest` / `policy` in the endpoint-authz matrix.
  - `@ds/portal` — the room mounts a visibility-gated `PresenceHeartbeat` loop (no
    doctor-facing affordance): it POSTs a beat every N seconds — N from
    `RoomConfig.heartbeatIntervalSeconds` (server config, default 60 s) — while the
    tab is the visible, active tab (Page Visibility API); a backgrounded tab
    (`document.hidden`) emits none, and the loop resumes on re-visibility.

  Cadence N is server config, parameterized downstream: the per-doctor
  minute derivation + concurrent-tab coalescing is EARS-5 ([#581](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/581)), room-close
  refusal is EARS-7 ([#583](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/583)), chat is EARS-3 ([#579](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/579)). The 006↔007 lifecycle seam
  (live/ended driven by seeded events until 007 lands) is unchanged.

  When a caller reaches `/webinars/:slug/room` but is not admissible, the room now
  routes them TRUTHFULLY per the server-side gate outcome (EARS-1) — never a soft
  wall over a rendered player (feature 006, EARS-6; realizes US-1, US-5). The room
  adds no auth or registration primitive; it consumes the shipped 003 auth and 005
  register flows and makes each denied branch a complete, guided front door.

  - Unauthenticated → through the 003 auth flow carrying a `returnTo` back to the
    ROOM url, so on login (or signup) the gate RE-RUNS on return and admits a
    registered doctor to a live room. New `lib/room-return.ts` guard parses the
    room-return target (`/webinars/<slug>/room`) reusing the hardened `@ds/schemas`
    slug validation (open-redirect-safe); `completeReturnTarget` routes a room
    return to the room and fires NO registration (a visitor is never silently joined
    to the roster), and `withReturnTarget` carries it through the signup hop.
  - Authenticated-but-unregistered → guided to the 005 register front door on the
    event page (`?from=room`), which surfaces catalog-sourced access-branch guidance
    (EARS-10) above the one-tap register CTA; on register the doctor re-enters the
    room, admitted.
  - Event not `live` → the truthful 004 lifecycle state on the event page, with no
    watchable room and no register banner.

  All copy resolves through the typed message catalog (new `room.accessGuidance`,
  EARS-10). Verified end-to-end on the live stand
  (`e2e/room-access-branches.spec.ts`, all three branches) — no branch renders the
  player, chat, or room composition. The 006↔007 lifecycle seam (live/ended driven
  by seeded events until 007 lands) is unchanged; Stage-B canvas fidelity is batched

  - `@ds/api` — the `MyEvents` read model: `GET /v1/me/events`,

AIR_WINDOW_MS` — mirroring the 004 upcoming listing), ordered **nearest

### Patch Changes

- [#687](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/687) [`d57ac0c`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/d57ac0c7b609f1ace068c67af2181c54ee1181e2) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(room): 006 EARS-7 — room-close stops heartbeat + chat capture

  When the event leaves `live` (the director closes the room, feature 007), the
  system stops accepting heartbeats and chat posts for that event and the room
  degrades to the truthful ended state (feature 006, EARS-7; realizes US-3, US-4).
  This handler adds no new code path — the refusal is the SAME server-side admission
  gate as EARS-1 (`authenticated ∧ registered ∧ live`): once the event leaves `live`
  the `live` condition fails and every room operation is refused server-side. EARS-7
  pins that close semantics as one coherent, verified story.

  - `@ds/api` — the `RoomConfig` grant read, the gated heartbeat, and the gated chat
    post are each refused with a `409` carrying the truthful `ended` state once the
    room closes. A beat/post accepted while the room was open is refused the instant
    it closes, and NO beat or post lands after close (`presence_beats` does not grow).
    Per-doctor presence minutes (EARS-5) are therefore computed over the beats
    captured **while the room was open** — a beat refused after close never exists,
    so it cannot inflate the sponsor minutes. Pinned by the Vitest e2e
    (`apps/api/test/room/room-close.e2e-spec.ts`).
  - `@ds/portal` — the room surface degrades TRUTHFULLY: after close the gate no
    longer issues the grant, so the `not-live` branch routes the doctor to the 004
    ended lifecycle state («Эфир завершён») with no watchable player, no writable
    chat, and no room composition — never a soft wall over a dead room. Verified
    end-to-end on the live stand (`apps/portal/e2e/room-close.spec.ts`).

  The 006↔007 lifecycle seam is unchanged (the live → ended transition is driven by

The screen now
  composes the already-re-skinned design-system blocks (`AuthCard`, `AuthLayout`,
  `OtpFocusScreen`, `Tabs`, `Button` — [#512](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/512)/[#517](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/517)) into the canvas `auth.dc.html`
  composition: the brand panel gains an eyebrow caps-label above a heavier headline +
  sub-copy (the shared `AuthShell` aside, mirrored by the showcase `NeutralAside`), the
  password ⇄ one-time-code segment control and the «Эл. почта | SMS» channel selector
  read in the canvas language and split the row into equal halves. Purely visual — no
  form logic, BFF call, resend cooldown, OTP length (still 8), or behaviour changed.

  language ([#519](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/519)). Each screen now composes the already-re-skinned design-system blocks
  (`AuthCard`, `AuthLayout`, `OtpFocusScreen`, `Alert`, `Button` — [#512](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/512)/[#513](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/513)/[#517](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/517)) into
  the canvas `auth.dc.html` composition, matching the merged `/login` re-skin ([#518](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/518)):

  - register: canvas title/description/consent copy.
  - verify: the two co-equal sections gain the canvas eyebrow caps-labels; the accepted
    code shows a «Код принят — входим…» success row (the DS `Alert` success variant)
    while the auto-login replay routes; «Войти» reads as the primary action.
  - reset: the card title tracks the stage («Сброс пароля» → «Новый пароль»), canvas
    code/label copy, and the «← Вернуться ко входу» back link.

  Purely visual — no form logic, BFF call, resend cooldown, OTP length (verify/reset
  still 6), or consent semantics changed.

### Patch Changes

The `Button` base carries `whitespace-nowrap`, so the longer verify/reset resend copy («Отправить повторно можно через N с») could neither wrap nor shrink in the `justify-between` row and pushed past the card's right border (owner-reported on /reset). Two changes: (1) the verify + reset resend copy now matches the canvas canonical form the login OTP screen already uses — «Отправить снова» / «Отправить снова · N с»; (2) the resend control on the shared `<OtpFocusScreen>` block and the inline reset/verify rows gains `min-w-0 whitespace-normal text-right` (with `shrink-0` on the neighbouring change-method / start-over control) so the cooldown label wraps instead of overflowing at any width, both themes. Cooldown timing/logic unchanged.

Every async
  submit now drives the shared `Button.loading` affordance from its in-flight flag
  (`loading={isSubmitting}`) instead of a static `disabled={isSubmitting}` — a
  determinate spinner + `aria-busy` + disabled-while-loading, so the surface reads as
  "working" instead of appearing to hang (the [#333](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/333) Stage-B owner finding). Covers
  login (password + OTP request), register, reset (request + complete), verify, and the
  shared `<OtpFocusScreen>` block. `prefers-reduced-motion` and the double-submit guard
  are already satisfied by `Button.loading`. The standard is documented in ADR-0013 §7
  and enforced by a new `submit-pending` lint guard (WARN).

  - **K-1 — over-spacing → inline message.** `FormMessage` no longer reserves a permanent `min-h-5` line under every field (the slice-B blank-line over-spacing); it renders **on demand** — the helper (muted) by default, swapping the error into its place on failure, and **nothing** at rest when there is neither. Error/helper text is `text-xs` (12 px) and **not bold**. Forms space fields with `space-y-4` (16 px) — larger than the in-field gap — so a message reads as belonging to **its** field, not the next one (proximity). Long forms (>3 fields) use an error-summary panel below submit (rule documented; `<FormErrorSummary>` deferred to the first such form).
  - **K-2 — glued tabs on hover → gap track.** `TabsList` gains a `gap-2` track between segments so an inactive segment's hover fill never butts flush against the active one (the slice-B hover-gluing).
  - **K-3 — "red mush" → mark the field.** Invalidity is carried by the input border + a destructive focus ring (`aria-invalid:border-destructive` / `aria-invalid:focus-visible:ring-destructive`) + the message; the **label stays neutral** (no more red label + red helper + red message).
  - Standard updated to match shipped reality: ADR-0013 §7 (Form layout & validation contract; segment-separation [#4](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/4)) + the design-system README (`Form layout standard` + clickable matrix). Portal auth forms (`/login`, `/register`, `/reset`, `/verify`) adopt `space-y-4`. Live-verified on the dev stand across login (password + OTP), register, and verify.

- [#330](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/330) [`e909b86`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/e909b861843e28dc0fee68e24f96774437bc39ea) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - OTP focus-resend on `/verify` and `/reset` code steps ([#227](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/227), [#267](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/267), EARS-24/25).

  - **`/verify`** — the existence-agnostic dual-affordance verify screen (enter the email code AND the co-equal «Войти» / «Сбросить пароль», EARS-24) now offers **resend-with-cooldown** wired to the real `POST /v1/auth/verify/resend` endpoint (EARS-25, [#319](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/319)). A successful resend re-issues the code, restarts the 30s cooldown, and clears the stale typed code; the layout keeps both co-equal paths (it is NOT collapsed into the single-focus `OtpFocusScreen`). The resend control is hidden on a bare deep-link with no `?email=` destination to target. Auto-submit and the EARS-16 generic outcome are preserved.
  - **`/reset`** — the complete step (code + new password submitted together) gains a **resend-with-cooldown** wired to the existing `requestPasswordReset(identifier)` (no new backend) plus a **«Начать заново»** action that returns to the request step to change the identifier. The code+password-together shape is kept (no auto-submit, intentional).
  - **Bot-protection (EARS-17).** Both resend endpoints are `@BotProtected`, so each resend carries its own captcha token via `BotProtectionField` (renders nothing when no provider is configured — the dev default — so the guard short-circuits to ok). The `/verify` screen, which previously had no bot-protection field, now renders one for its resend.
  - **`@ds/portal`** — new `authClient.resendVerification` BFF helper and a `useResendCooldown` hook factoring the shared resend orchestration (nonce bump + clear-stale-code + error routing + success acknowledgement) across `/login`, `/verify`, `/reset`.
  - **Neutral, enumeration-safe resend confirmation ([#326](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/326))** — a resend on `/verify` and `/reset` now shows a generic, identical-in-every-case `role="status"` confirmation (it previously re-armed the cooldown but acknowledged nothing — a "dead button"). The "account exists" fact is disclosed out-of-band by email, never on-screen (OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet + WSTG account-enumeration; Clerk user-enumeration-protection); the confirmation is conditionally phrased and asserts nothing about account existence. UI-only — a resend sends no additional notice email.
  - **`@ds/design-system`** — new exported `useResendCountdown` hook factoring the live resend-cooldown timer; `OtpFocusScreen` now composes it, and the `/reset` inline resend (which can't adopt the whole block) reuses the identical timer instead of duplicating the interval logic.

  **Systemic auth-surface polish (live-review findings — apply to every auth surface, not just slice B):**

  - **`secondary` Button variant** redefined — the borderless light fill read as "disabled"; it now carries a resting border (parity with `outline`), a tonal fill, a brand-ring hover, and a darker active, so a secondary action (login OTP «Отправить код», verify «Войти») reads as clearly enabled/clickable.
  - **Form field layout (no reflow on error)** — `FormMessage` now always renders a reserved one-line slot (`min-h`, `aria-hidden` while empty), so showing/hiding a validation message no longer grows the form; `FormItem` uses a clearer label→control gap so the focus ring never touches the label.
  - **`OtpFocusScreen` resend label** uses `tabular-nums` so the countdown digits don't jitter as the seconds tick (also applied to the `/verify` and `/reset` inline resend labels).
  - **`/reset` complete step** — the «Начать заново» + resend footer is separated from the password field with a top border + spacing (was jammed against the input).

  cooldown without a remount. The block previously re-seeded its countdown only
  when `cooldownSeconds` changed, so a resend re-issuing the same duration could
  not restart it — the portal login worked around this by remounting the verify
  form via `key={resendNonce}`. Consumers now bump `resendNonce` instead; the
  portal login drops the remount hack and clears the stale code explicitly on the
  same signal.

The brand panel uses the new AA-safe `primary-surface` token (blue.700 `#114D9E`, white 8.14:1) — `primary` (blue.500) only clears AA for large/bold text, so a colour panel carrying normal-weight copy uses `primary-surface` (ADR-0013 §7). Logos ship as SVG (ADR-0013 §8): the clean white variant sits directly on the panel (no `bg-card` chip), and the form-column logo is `lg:hidden` so there is exactly one logo per viewport. Passwordless OTP login now renders the `OtpFocusScreen` block once a code is requested — masked destination + auto-submit + resend-with-cooldown + change-method — closing the [#192](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/192)/[#196](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/196)/[#200](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/200)/[#211](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/211)/[#212](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/212)/[#227](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/227) papercut class. Masked destinations also applied to the verify/reset code steps. App glue (BFF `/v1/auth/*`, EARS-16 generic errors, i18n, auto-submit) is unchanged — only the presentation layer moved onto the system.

The `AuthLayout` split-screen shipped with the inherited shadcn `login-03` default (form-left / panel-right), but the [#237](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/237) settled product-owner decision is brand-panel LEFT, form RIGHT. The form column stays first in source order (a11y — the interactive surface precedes the decorative panel) and is flipped visually on `lg+` via `lg:order-2` (panel `lg:order-1`); the `< lg` single-column layout (panel hidden, form fills) is unchanged.

  Two product-owner-approved refinements to feature 003 found in live testing, both
  shipped together.

  **Auto-login after password reset ([#221](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/221), EARS-12).** Completing a password reset
  no longer drops the user back on `/login`. `POST /v1/auth/password/reset/complete`
  keeps the global force-logout (`revokeAllForSub`) and the `PasswordResetCompleted`
  audit, then mints a **fresh authenticated session** for the subject via the same
  `SessionService.establish` hop login uses — emitting the identical session-created
  `LoginSucceeded` audit row and setting the `__Host-ds_session` cookie. The
  response body stays token-free (`{status:"reset_completed"}`, EARS-8). The IdP
  port's `completePasswordReset` now returns a checked `IdpSession` (the real
  adapter runs a `POST /v2/sessions` password check with the new password; the
  `FakeIdpClient` is no more permissive). The portal `/reset` page routes to
  `/account` on success. A bad/expired code or unknown identifier is unchanged — the
  same generic 400, no session, no existence oracle (EARS-16).

  **Forgiving auth rate-limit ([#222](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/222), EARS-13, ADR-0001 §7).** The per-user EARS-13
  ceiling is raised **5 → 10 / 15 min** so a normal forgot-password → login recovery
  flow is not throttled mid-journey (per-IP 20/15 min and per-ASN 100/h unchanged).
  A **successful** login AND a **successful** reset-complete now **forgive** (clear)
  the per-user window for that identifier (`RateLimitService.reset({ip, identifier})`,
  keyed identically to the guard), so a recovering user is never stranded. Only the
  per-user window is forgiven — per-IP / per-ASN are deliberately left intact. The
  throttled response stays generic (no account-existence oracle).

- [#199](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/199) [`a381363`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/a38136342b366df2dcbac73f674e8f806cd3b6e9) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(portal): [#197](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/197) enforce field validation/mask by construction — semantic field primitives + ESLint gate (003)

  Portal auth forms were assembled from raw design-system `<Input>` + a per-form
  loose resolver, so validation/mask was hand-wired field-by-field and easy to
  forget — the root cause of the live defects [#192](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/192) (`/login` identifier) and [#196](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/196)
  (`/reset` identifier). This lands the enforced-by-construction layer of EARS-22
  (003 design §8.2):

  - **Five semantic field primitives** (`apps/portal/components/fields`):
    `EmailField`, `PhoneField`, `OtpField`, `PasswordField`, and `IdentifierField`
    (the email-or-phone union box). Each bakes in validation + (where relevant) the
    E.164 phone mask + a11y + RU copy and co-locates its zod resolver fragment, so
    no per-call wiring. The loose `@ds/schemas` request contracts are unchanged.
  - **A custom ESLint gate** (`local/no-raw-auth-field-input`) that makes a raw
    credential `<Input>` — or a hand-rolled native `<input>` — impossible to render
    on the auth surfaces; the field must come from the primitives. Rides the
    existing `lint` CI job.
  - **All auth surfaces migrated** with behavior preserved ([#192](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/192)/[#175](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/175) intact), and
    **/reset identifier now validated + masked-aware** — the [#196](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/196) fix.
  - **`@ds/schemas`** now exports the creation-password fragment as
    `NewPasswordSchema` (was a private `NewPassword`), so the portal composes the
    complexity baseline from the SSOT instead of re-declaring the regex — additive,
    the request schemas are unchanged.

- [#168](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/168) [`f1e21ff`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/f1e21ffffdecdc26712fc6ae9ef92c19f1c53d01) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(portal): [#131](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/131) wire the portal auth journeys against the live BFF (003 F7)

  Feature 003 shipped the auth BFF (`apps/api`, all `/v1/auth/*` routes live) but
  NO portal wiring — the login page only `console.log`ged, there was no
  register/verify/OTP/reset surface, the OTP input was a visual stub, and the form
  re-declared its own zod schema. No auth journey was completable in a browser.
  This is the milestone-completing vertical slice: the integrating UI layer plus a
  real browser E2E so the slice works end to end.

  **Same-origin BFF proxy (mandatory).** The session is the `__Host-ds_session`
  cookie, which `__Host-` locks to the exact origin that set it (no Domain). So the
  portal serves the BFF under its OWN origin: a Next `rewrites()` maps `/v1/:path*`
  to an env-driven upstream (`API_PROXY_TARGET`), and every form fetches the
  relative `/v1/auth/*` path with `credentials: "include"`. No CORS, no
  cross-origin cookie, and the access/refresh tokens never reach client JS (EARS-8).

  **Surfaces.** `/register` (EARS-1/2, email|phone toggle + consent + bot-protection
  → pending_verification), `/verify` (EARS-3/4, OTP from Mailpit), `/login` —
  password (EARS-5, single `identifier` box matching `LoginRequestSchema`, NOT the
  old `email` field) AND passwordless OTP (EARS-6 email / EARS-7 SMS, channel
  selector + request/verify), `/reset` (EARS-11/12, initiate → complete), and an
  `/account` session shell that reads `GET /v1/auth/session`, attempts one silent
  `POST /refresh`-then-retry on a 401 (EARS-9) before redirecting to `/login`, and
  logs out (EARS-10).

  **Schemas SSOT.** Every form validates with the `@ds/schemas` zod schemas via
  `@hookform/resolvers/zod`; the re-declared `signInSchema` is deleted. A small
  `lib/auth-client.ts` carries the token-free same-origin fetch surface typed by
  the `@ds/schemas` request/response types.

  **Browser E2E (real-Zitadel tier).** A new Playwright suite mirrors the api
  `zitadel-otp-login.e2e-spec.ts` pattern exactly: it drives a real browser through
  register→verify→login(password)→session→logout and the email-OTP journey, reading
  the REAL codes from Mailpit (never the FakeIdpClient `424242`), and asserts the
  no-token invariant (only `__Host-ds_session`, HttpOnly; no access/refresh token in
  `document.cookie`/`localStorage`/`sessionStorage`/JWT-shaped blob). It is gated on
  the dev-stand env (`IDP_*` + `E2E_PORTAL_URL`) and `test.skip`s otherwise, so it is
  NOT wired into CI or `pnpm test` — a manual dev-stand gate, same posture as the api
  LIVE_OIDC specs. SMS-OTP has no dev-stand provider: the UI is built but the E2E
  declares it a parity-only skip, not faked green.

### Patch Changes

- [#201](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/201) [`1e45957`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/1e45957ac70d20c67b80b7f612d85d8421fafb67) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - Localize the creation-password complexity error to RU and validate auth forms on blur ([#200](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/200), 003).

  `@ds/schemas` now exports `NEW_PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY`, the bare creation-password
  complexity regex, as the single SSOT for the pattern. `NewPasswordSchema` is
  rebuilt from it and keeps its deliberately-generic English DTO message unchanged
  (no API behavior change). The portal's `NewPasswordFieldSchema` composes the regex
  **without** a message so the localized resolver maps the resulting `invalid_format`
  issue to the RU `errors.validation.passwordComplexity` copy — in zod v4 a
  schema-level message would otherwise outrank the contextual error map and leak
  English on `/register` and `/reset`.

  `/register` and `/reset` (complete step) now resolve from portal-composed,
  channel-specific schemas built from the field primitives (mirroring the existing
  OTP-login pattern) instead of the request schemas; the submitted body and the API
  contract are unchanged. All auth forms run in `mode: "onTouched"` so a malformed
  email/phone/password is flagged on blur, before submit.

### Minor Changes

- [#116](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/116) [`abca9ca`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/abca9ca9ee9d7f07dfbaffcbe4d3c131b0bfa14e) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(api,portal): [#84](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/84) bootstrap BotProtection abstraction + Yandex SmartCaptcha adapter

  003 is the platform's first consumer of bot protection, so it bootstraps the
  mechanism behind an interface rather than a separate package (design §10.1,
  ADR-0001 open-q [#7](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/7)). Backend (`@ds/api`): a `BotProtection` provider interface
  (`verify(token, action, clientIp) → ok`) bound to the `BOT_PROTECTION` DI token,
  a Yandex SmartCaptcha adapter (RF-accessible; fail-closed on any error), a
  `@BotProtected(action)` decorator, and a global `BotProtectionGuard` that no-ops
  unless a handler opts in — so swapping the provider (DSO-26) never touches a call
  site. Disabled by default (`BOT_PROTECTION_ENABLED=false`) so the dev-stand runs
  without a Yandex account.

  Frontend (`@ds/portal`): a provider-neutral `BotProtectionField` wrapping a
  self-contained Yandex SmartCaptcha widget that emits the token the guard
  verifies, wired onto the sign-in scaffold. EARS-17 policy (which surfaces, when)
  is owned by 003 F1/F5/F6; this ships the mechanism only. Closes [#84](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/84).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#114](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/pull/114) [`0feefc5`](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/commit/0feefc5a37768db4f03042688b22b64908a449c9) Thanks [@sidorovanthon](https://github.com/sidorovanthon)! - feat(frontend): scaffold apps/portal + graduate packages/design-system (auth-form set)

  Graduates `@ds/design-system` from a stub to the Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui
  owned-code component set the 003 inline auth forms need (ADR-0004 §6): a single
  token sheet (`globals.css`) whose one `--radius` derives the whole radius scale
  via `@theme inline`, plus `Button`, `Input`, `Label`, `Card`, the RHF `<Form>`
  binding (ADR-0004 §9), and `InputOTP`. Components ship as source and are
  transpiled by consumers (`transpilePackages`).

  Scaffolds `@ds/portal` as a Next.js 16 App Router app (`output: 'standalone'`,
  no Vercel runtime — ADR-0004 §2.3/§3/§7): app shell + a sign-in page wiring the
  RHF + `@hookform/resolvers/zod` + `<Form>` + `<InputOTP>` stack end to end. The
  BFF calls and the OIDC silent-re-auth middleware land with feature 003. Closes
  [#82](https://github.com/doctor-school/ds-platform/issues/82).
