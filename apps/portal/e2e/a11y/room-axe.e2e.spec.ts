/**
 * 006 EARS-11 (#681, the decision-debt tracked out of #578 / PR #680) — repeatable
 * axe-core WCAG 2 A/AA scan of the REAL portal room route `/webinars/[slug]/room`
 * (spec `apps/docs/content/specs/features/006-webinar-room/`). It is the
 * portal-route twin of the `WebinarRoomLayout` showcase entry in the CI
 * `playwright-axe` BLOCK gate: the gate pins the DS primitive's geometry states,
 * while this spec scans the COMPOSED gated room a doctor actually reaches — the
 * 006 room header bar, the event context, the live chat aside, and the player
 * frame chrome — behind the real EARS-1 admission (authenticated ∧ registered ∧
 * live) on the seeded live room.
 *
 * SCOPE — the third-party provider EMBED SUBTREE (`room-player-rutube` /
 * `room-player-youtube`) is EXCLUDED: per EARS-9 the stream is a configured
 * provider FRAME only — the iframe's inner document is the provider's own
 * surface, outside the EARS-9 frame boundary and outside our remediation reach
 * (the same "not ours to fix here" rationale family as the sibling specs'
 * `.bg-header` exclusion of the 004 poster). The truthful stream-unavailable
 * state (`room-player-unavailable`) is OUR OWN surface and is NOT excluded.
 *
 * `.bg-header` EXCLUDED AS TRACKED 006 DEBT (#713) — the room route renders no
 * 004 poster; its only `.bg-header` surface is the 006-OWNED room app-header
 * bar (`room-header.tsx`), which carries two REAL AA contrast findings this
 * scan surfaced on 2026-07-10: the presence count (`room-presence-count`) and
 * the desktop exit-link label, both white `header-foreground` on `bg-header`
 * (blue.500) at `text-sm` bold = 3.69:1 < the 4.5:1 normal-text minimum (the
 * `header` token's large/bold ≥3:1 carve-out starts at 18.67px and was
 * misapplied to 14px-bold text). The design fix (size bump vs. a dedicated AA
 * header token vs. the #702 theming bundle) is Issue #713; excluding the band
 * keeps this scan a live regression gate for the REST of the room composition
 * meanwhile — the same tracked-debt pattern as the 004 poster `.bg-header`
 * exclusions in the sibling specs. Narrowing/removing this exclude is an
 * acceptance criterion of #713.
 *
 * Dev-stand-gated like the sibling 005 scan: it provisions a real 003 doctor
 * (register + Mailpit OTP verify, auto-login) carrying a `returnTo` that also
 * completes the REAL 005 registration for the seeded live room, then enters the
 * room and scans. It `test.skip`s unless the live stand env is present, so a
 * stray CI invocation is inert.
 *
 * BOTH THEMES (006 EARS-13, #702): the room header now ships the portal's theme
 * toggle — `.dark` on `<html>` is user-reachable on this very surface, so the
 * composed room is scanned in light AND dark (`THEMES` drives the matrix; the
 * scan applies the theme through the same class mechanism the toggle uses). A
 * dark render must introduce no new axe violations relative to light. The DS
 * primitive geometry is additionally covered (both themes) by the CI
 * `playwright-axe` gate via the showcase.
