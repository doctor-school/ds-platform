 * 005 EARS-2 — resume the carried event-registration once the 003 session exists.
 *
 * A guest who activated «Участвовать» is taken through the shipped 003
 * login/signup flow carrying a safe, same-origin registration-intent (the event
 * slug + a `/webinars/<slug>` returnTo — the `@ds/schemas` `parseReturnTarget`
 * guard). This module is the RESUME side of that handoff, run by the auth pages
 * the moment a session is established (`/login` password + OTP success, `/verify`
 * post-registration auto-login): it fires the SAME `RegisterForEvent` (EARS-1) and
 * lands the doctor back on that event page in the registered state — no re-search,
 * no second «Участвовать» tap, the event context intact across the round-trip.
 *
 * There is NO server-side "postponed registration" record (the retired legacy
 * mechanism): the intent lived only in the round-trip's returnTo, and the real
 * command fires once, here, after the session exists (design §3.2).

 *
 * The register call is best-effort: if it throws (a transient error, a gating
 * refusal), the doctor is still landed on the event page — the per-user
