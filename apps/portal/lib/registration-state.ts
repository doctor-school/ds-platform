 * 004's `GetPublicEventPage` (`lib/public-events`) stays public, cookie-free, and
 * content-identical for guest and principal. The doctor's registration state is a
 * SEPARATE authenticated read (design §4): this module fetches
 * `GET /v1/events/:idOrSlug/registration` server-side, forwarding the session
 * cookie of the incoming request, and never touches the public fetch or its
 * shared data cache. A guest (no session) simply gets `null` here and sees 004's
 * register CTA.
 *
 * The upstream is the same env-driven `API_PROXY_TARGET` the portal's rewrite +
 * the public reader use (`next.config.ts` / `lib/public-events`) — never a
 * hardcoded host, so dev and prod differ by config only.

 * therefore present the SAME `user-agent` + `accept-language` as the browser, not

 * 005 EARS-5 — the registered doctor's join-signpost render mode: HOW/WHEN they

 * The signpost derives from the registration state + the canvas lifecycle
 * `status` — never from the primary CTA (a registered doctor has no register
 * CTA to key off). There are exactly two signpost renders plus the fall-through:
 *
 *   • `upcoming` — the doctor is registered on an `upcoming` (`published`)
 *     event: signpost that they are registered and when the broadcast starts
 *     (date/time МСК). The register CTA is replaced by a static confirmation —
 *     no second action (EARS-4/EARS-5).
 *   • `live` — the doctor is registered on a `live` event: signpost that the
 *     broadcast is on and they are on the participant list. The interactive
 *     onward-to-room affordance is the 006 room surface (#584) — until the room
 *     ships, the signpost is textual (a `/room` link would be a dead link / 404,
 *     a banned pattern; the deferral is tracked on #584).
 *   • `none` — every other case: `ended` / `archived` (no participation CTA — 004
 *     owns those renders), an unregistered doctor, or a guest (004's register CTA
 *     stands). No signpost is composed onto the public page.
