# Zitadel — OIDC application bootstrap (reproducible, per recipe)

The `idp` service (Zitadel v4, single binary, DB-backed) comes up self-contained
from `compose.core.yml` and serves OIDC discovery at the root once healthy. This
file turns the _application-level_ setup — the OIDC client the api BFF logs in
through, plus the org-owner credential the provisioner needs — into a scripted,
re-runnable procedure. No console click-paths.

All commands assume the **TrueNAS Hybrid** recipe (`DEV_SSH_HOST=truenas`,
`sudo docker`, remote dir `~/ds-platform-dev-stand`). On a host-only recipe drop
the `ssh truenas` prefix and the `sudo`. Endpoints come from your `.env.local` —
substitute your own `HOST`/ports; the values shown are the reference recipe's.

> **HOST choice.** The issuer must be the address the api on your dev machine
> resolves _and_ the address Zitadel advertises in discovery — they must be
> byte-identical or every OIDC client rejects the issuer. The reference recipe
> uses `truenas.local` (mDNS resolves from Windows to `192.168.1.115`); fall back

## 0. Snapshot first (destructive steps follow)

A re-init drops the `zitadel` database. **Snapshot before touching it**
(AGENTS.md §9.3):

```bash
pnpm dev:snapshot pre-zitadel-reinit
# TrueNAS recipe, by hand if the launcher isn't usable from your env:
ssh truenas 'sudo zfs snapshot "Daily SSD/dev-postgres@pre-zitadel-reinit-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"'
```

Only the `zitadel` DB and the `idp` container are ever in scope. **Never** touch
`ds_dev` or any other service.

---

## 1. When do you need a re-init?

You need a re-init **only** to (re)create the bootstrap machine user, or to change
`IDP_EXTERNAL_DOMAIN`. If `curl http://<HOST>:9080/.well-known/openid-configuration`
already advertises the right `"issuer"` and a `ds-bootstrap` org-owner user
exists, skip to step 3 (provisioning).

Zitadel stores `ExternalDomain` in the DB at first init; the container env var
only seeds it on a _fresh_ init. Changing the env var on an already-initialised
instance does nothing — you must re-init.

---

## 2. Re-init with a declarative bootstrap machine user

`compose.core.yml` carries an opt-in FIRSTINSTANCE block, gated on `IDP_BOOTSTRAP`.
When set, the init step creates an IAM-owner machine user `ds-bootstrap`, a console
admin `zitadel-admin` with a known password, writes the machine user's PAT to a
readable file, and enables the **Login V2** feature.

> **Login V2 is required — do not disable it.** The api BFF uses a headless
> Variant-B exchange (apps/api auth design §3, EARS-8): it links a server-checked
> session to a pending OIDC auth request via `POST /v2/oidc/auth_requests/{id}`.
> That session-link API only resolves an auth request **created under Login V2**;
> with the feature off the authorize hop files a v1 auth request the v2 API can't
> see and the link 404s (`Auth Request does not exist`, proven live #146). The v2
> login _UI_ ships as a separate Next.js `login` container — but the BFF never
> renders it (no `baseUri` is configured), so the single-binary stand needs no
> extra service: the `auth_requests` + token endpoints live in the core binary.
> An earlier revision of this bootstrap forced Login V2 off; that was wrong and is
> reverted.

In your `.env.local` (synced to the remote `.env` on `dev:up`):

```ini
IDP_EXTERNAL_DOMAIN=truenas.local       # = your HOST
IDP_ISSUER=http://truenas.local:9080    # bare origin, no path
IDP_PORT=9080
IDP_BOOTSTRAP=1                          # ONLY during the re-init
IDP_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<pick one>  # dev-only; needs upper+lower+digit+symbol
```

Drop the `zitadel` DB and recreate the `idp` container so `start-from-init`
re-inits onto a fresh DB:

```bash
ssh truenas 'cd ~/ds-platform-dev-stand && \
  sudo docker compose -f compose.core.yml stop idp && \
  sudo docker compose -f compose.core.yml rm -f idp && \
  sudo docker exec ds-platform-dev-postgres-1 psql -U ds -d ds_dev -c \
    "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname='"'"'zitadel'"'"' AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();" && \
  sudo docker exec ds-platform-dev-postgres-1 psql -U ds -d ds_dev -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS zitadel;" && \
  sudo docker compose -f compose.core.yml up -d idp'
```

Wait for health, then verify the issuer:

```bash
curl -s http://truenas.local:9080/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq -r .issuer
# -> http://truenas.local:9080
```

### Obtaining the bootstrap PAT (fully scriptable — no console)

`ZITADEL_FIRSTINSTANCE_PATPATH` writes the machine user's PAT to `/pat/pat.txt`
on init. The earlier "the file is never written" claim was a **mount-ownership**
bug, not an init bug: the distroless image runs as the non-root `zitadel` user
(uid/gid 1000), and a default tmpfs / named volume is root-owned, so the process
couldn't create the file. `compose.core.yml` now mounts the PAT tmpfs owned by
uid/gid 1000 (`tmpfs: /pat:uid=1000,gid=1000,mode=0700`), so the file lands
readable. Copy it straight out of the container — no console, no devtools:

```bash
ssh truenas 'PID=$(sudo docker inspect ds-platform-dev-idp-1 --format "{{.State.Pid}}"); \
  sudo cat /proc/$PID/root/pat/pat.txt' > ~/.ds-platform/idp-bootstrap-pat.txt
# (distroless has no shell, so read the file through the host /proc view of the
# container rootfs rather than `docker exec cat`.)
```

The file is gitignored by living under `~/.ds-platform/` — **never** commit it.
Then flip `IDP_BOOTSTRAP=` back off (so normal boots don't re-trigger init).

> The deterministic `zitadel-admin` console user is still created (handy for
> interactive console work), but the PAT no longer needs it.

---

## 3. Provision the OIDC application (idempotent)

`idp/provision.sh` creates (or converges) the `ds-platform-dev` project, the
web/OIDC application (`authorization_code` + `refresh_token`, BASIC auth, dev-mode
http redirect URIs), the project-role assertion so
`urn:zitadel:iam:org:project:roles` is emitted in the token, and seeds the
`doctor_guest` role. It also **ensures the Login V2 instance feature** (a no-op if
the FIRSTINSTANCE default already set it — converges instances created before that
default), **grants `IAM_LOGIN_CLIENT`** to the `ds-bootstrap` machine user —
without it the EARS-8 session-link call returns `403 No matching permissions found`
(`IAM_OWNER` alone is not sufficient) — and **configures + activates an SMTP
provider aimed at Mailpit** (`mailpit:1025`) so verification/reset codes (EARS-3)
are actually delivered (Zitadel ships with no SMTP provider, so `email/resend`
200s but mails nothing until this is set; the live email-verify test #148 depends
on it). Re-running converges — it never duplicates.

```bash
# Runs on a box with bash + curl + jq (the TrueNAS box has all three):
ssh truenas 'cd ~/ds-platform-dev-stand/idp && \
  IDP_BASE_URL=http://truenas.local:9080 ./provision.sh --pat-file /tmp/idp-pat.txt'
```

It prints `IDP_PROJECT_ID`, `IDP_CLIENT_ID`, and — **only on first creation** —
`IDP_CLIENT_SECRET`, each already prefixed with its `.env.local` key so the lines
append straight in. Capture them. (Re-runs do not re-emit the secret; rotate it
with the `_generate_client_secret` call the script prints if you lose it.) On every
run it also echoes (to stderr) the **redirect URIs it registered** and the
`IDP_REDIRECT_URI=` line to copy (the api BFF `:3000` callback), plus a reminder
that a full api boot additionally needs `AUDIT_IDENTIFIER_PEPPER` — so both #159
values are discoverable on each (re)provision.

Override defaults via env / flags: `IDP_REDIRECT_URIS`, `IDP_POST_LOGOUT_URIS`,
`IDP_SEED_ROLE`, `IDP_SMTP_HOST` (default `mailpit:1025`), `IDP_SMTP_SENDER_ADDRESS`,
`IDP_SMTP_SENDER_NAME`, `--project-name`, `--app-name`. Defaults target the api BFF
callback (`:3000/auth/callback`) and the portal (`:3100/auth/callback`).

## 4. Wire `.env.local`

```ini
IDP_ISSUER=http://truenas.local:9080          # bare origin
IDP_EXTERNAL_DOMAIN=truenas.local
IDP_PORT=9080
IDP_CLIENT_ID=<from provision.sh>             # the numeric Zitadel client id
IDP_CLIENT_SECRET=<from provision.sh>
IDP_PROJECT_ID=<from provision.sh>            # the IDP_PROJECT_ID= line the script
                                              # emits; the project owning the
                                              # doctor_guest role.
                                              # Required to grant the project role per
                                              # user on register/webhook/reconcile (#157)
                                              # — the OIDC token's project-roles claim is
                                              # the authz source the guard reads; absent
                                              # it grantProjectRole fails closed and a
                                              # registered user 403s on protected routes.
IDP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback  # api BFF callback — runs
                                              # on the dev machine, so it is

                                              # URI provision.sh registers (it
                                              # echoes them on completion); a
                                              # truenas.local value is not
                                              # registered -> authorize 400 (#159).

To prove the live exchange end-to-end, run the integration spec with the OIDC env
exported (it `describe.skipIf`s without `IDP_ISSUER`/`IDP_CLIENT_ID`/
`IDP_SERVICE_TOKEN`/`IDP_REDIRECT_URI`):

```bash
# from apps/api, with the five IDP_* keys + DATABASE_URL exported from .env.local
npx vitest run test/auth/zitadel-token-exchange.e2e-spec.ts
# -> EARS-8 (session→token) + EARS-9 (refresh rotation) GREEN
```

## 5. Live wire-shape deltas (v4.15) — all resolved in the adapter

Running the real adapter against the live instance surfaced wire-shape deltas vs
the merged code. The EARS-8/9 token-exchange spec
(`apps/api/test/auth/zitadel-token-exchange.e2e-spec.ts`) now passes GREEN against
the dev-stand; the deltas it forced are fixed in `src/auth/idp/zitadel.idp.ts`:

- `POST /v2/users/human` **requires** a `profile` object (`givenName` /
  `familyName`) — fixed in `createUser` (#145, a placeholder profile the domain
  never reads).
- `POST /v2/sessions` does **not** echo `factors` in its response — the checked
  user's id is read via a follow-up `GET /v2/sessions/{id}` (#145).
- The authorize 302 redirects to `…?authRequest=V2_<id>` (lowercase `authRequest`,
  `V2_` prefix) under Login V2 — the adapter reads both `authRequestID` and
  `authRequest` (#122/#145).
- The **refresh** grant rejects the reserved `urn:zitadel:iam:org:project:roles`
  scope with `invalid_scope`; per RFC 6749 §6 a refresh may only narrow scope, so
  `refreshTokens` now sends **no** `scope` param (the roles claim still rides the
  rotated id_token via the app's role-assertion config). This was the EARS-9 fix.
- Duplicate-email create returns **409** (the adapter's enumeration hinge is
  correct); the happy path returns `{ userId, details }` (parsed correctly).
- The default password policy requires an upper-case character; live test
  fixtures use a mixed-case password accordingly.

Two instance-level prerequisites for the exchange (both applied by `provision.sh`,
documented in §2/§3): **Login V2 enabled**, and **`IAM_LOGIN_CLIENT`** on the
machine user the PAT belongs to.

The OTP-login legs (`requestEmailOtp` / `loginWith*Otp`) remain fail-closed seams
(tracked separately); they are not exercised by the token-exchange spec.
