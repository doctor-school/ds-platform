/**
 * The DATA a host states about itself so the ONE auth flow can serve it
 * (wave-1 entry gate §4.2, epic #2020 / #2027).
 *
 * Data only. There is no function-valued field here and the wave-1 adapter list
 * is CLOSED and EMPTY (gate §4.3): a divergence that fits neither a field below
 * nor a recorded owner decision is a question for the owner, never a host-local
 * variant of a rule the package owns.
 *
 * Wave 1 PR 1.3 declares only the fields this PR's four units consume. The route
 * table, the consent tiers, the brand assets, the landing table and the
 * `returnTo` parking of gate §4.2 arrive with the PRs that move their surfaces
 * (1.4–1.8); a field nothing reads yet would be a claim, not a contract.
